    <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Analysts, researchers, and organizations alike seem to agree that cloud computing will be a defining trend in the 
coming decade impacting a wide range of businesses and how those businesses are practiced. Large technology 
companies are already investing millions of dollars in building infrastructure, services, tools, and applications to 
facilitate cloud computing for consumers, organizations, and businesses to use and take advantage. It remains to 
be seen how cloud computing will impact the healthcare business since it is very diverse, complex, and unique 
and presents several challenges such as protecting members' health records in addition to following HIPAA 
guidelines set by federal compliance regulations. In addition to these, the rising cost of healthcare solutions is 
another major concern. Efforts are being made to reduce these costs for consumers, and IT will play a big role in 
achieving it and also improving clinical and quality outcomes for patients. It will be very interesting to see how 
cloud computing will address and contribute towards these issues in the healthcare industry. The purpose of this 
paper is to explore the current state and trends of cloud computing in healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> healthcare, cloud, security, HIPAA, EHR</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The advent of <strong>cloud computing</strong> and its business models have been some of the biggest changes impacting not 
only the computer industry but also several others. It is predicted that around 80% of the businesses from today’s 
world will be moved to the cloud by the year 2020 (<a href="source-link">Kuttikrishnan, 2011</a>). Organizations that do not have enough 
resources to invest and build infrastructure and platforms to deploy their applications can now take advantage of 
the <strong>cloud services</strong> to suit their specific needs. With the <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong> model the consumers pay for what they 
use and how much they use. The cloud has infrastructure built so consumers can deploy and run their 
applications. They also have different platforms with multiple operating systems so consumers can build, test, 
and deploy their applications in virtual servers. In addition, the cloud provides <strong>highly scalable</strong> environment to 
effectively handle the load. Since the infrastructure and platforms are already built and are available, consumers 
and organizations can save a lot since they don’t have to invest in them or maintain them. Some of the bigger 
organizations are investing in building their own <strong>private clouds</strong> by leveraging their existing infrastructure and 
tools.</p>

<p>Since the real life businesses and organizations normally build applications in quite a complex environment that 
involves networking, security, physical servers, firewalls etc. and transactions worth millions of dollars, they 
expect same or higher level of service provided by the cloud service providers and the cloud so their data is 
protected and the businesses are not negatively impacted. More and more tools are being built on the Internet 
that is important to run a business. <strong>Healthcare industry</strong> has been one of the businesses that traditionally repelled 
outsourcing mainly because of the security and privacy concerns. The member’s privacy and medical records are 
<strong>highly sensitive</strong> and the companies spend millions in protecting them while following the federal regulated 
guidelines. However, rising medical costs might change the way this business is performed.</p>

<h2>2. Moving to the Cloud</h2>
<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong> can play a critical role in containing healthcare integration costs, optimizing resources and 
ushering in a new era of innovations. Current trends aim towards accessing information anytime, anywhere, 
which can be achieved when moving healthcare information to the cloud. This new delivery model can make 
healthcare more efficient and effective, and at a lower cost to technology budgets (<a href="source-link">Horowitz, 2011</a>), but also, it 
brings certain obstacles due to concerns related with safeguarding confidential patient information and 
<a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/nct">compliance with key regulations such as HIPAA</a>. Despite these security and privacy risks, healthcare 
organizations can certainly take advantage of cloud computing solutions and bring tremendous benefits such as 
help to improve patient quality of service and reduce overall healthcare costs (<a href="source-link">Muir, 2011</a>).</p>

<p>One of the key benefits will be the ability to exchange data between disparate systems. This capability is 
something healthcare IT is desperately needs. For instance, cloud computing can support healthcare 
organizations to share information such as EHR, doctor’s references, prescriptions, insurance information, test 
results stored across different information systems. This is already happening in the radiological area, where 
many institutions have moved to the cloud to lower their storage costs and facilitate the exchange of images 
(<a href="source-link">Terry, 2012</a>).</p>

<p>Nine times out of 10, moving offsite is going to be more financially attractive than trying to build out your own 
organization in-house (<a href="source-link">Horowitz, 2011</a>). When offloading healthcare organizations the IT staff required to 
maintain network availability, security updates, backups and others can be free up to attend to more critical tasks 
in an efficient and cost-effective manner (<a href="source-link">Muir, 2011</a>). In addition, more reliable and powerful infrastructures 
will be available pay-as-you-go and it can be managed dynamically.</p>

<p>Another issue that needs addressing is the potential candidate to which to move. The last thing an organization 
wants is to move a lot of their processing to a third party and find out that it is going to be acquired by a 
company who the organization doesn’t necessarily want to be a partner with or just is going to dissolve 
(<a href="source-link">Horowitz, 2011</a>). The best cloud provide is one which that has been in the healthcare business already, so they 
know about HIPAA compliance and issues that go along with it. In addition, a well-defined plan and the right 
tools can support the transition to cloud-based systems to take advantage of the benefits it brings (<a href="source-link">Muir, 2011</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong> has given opportunities for clinics, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmacies, and other 
healthcare companies to agree in collaborating between them and share healthcare information to offer better 
quality of service and reduce costs. Looking over the changes occurring in the market, it appears that 
cloud-based systems will likely become the norm in healthcare once all the challenges it brings are overcome.</p>

<h2>3. Conclusions</h2>
<p>The current trend of adopting cloud computing in the medical field can improve and solve several collaborative 
information issues in healthcare organizations as well as cost optimizations. Standardized cloud-based 
applications will bring obvious advantages to patients, physicians, insurance companies, pharmacies, imaging 
centers, etc. when sharing information across medical organizations yielding better results. Challenges such as 
security concerns and interoperability will rise due to the cloud-computing model. Therefore, the adoption of the 
cloud is progressing slowly. Through the implementation of best practices in the design, deployment, and use of 
it will hopefully generate a future growth of the cloud-based systems adoption, despite all of the obstacles.</p>
